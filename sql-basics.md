### SQL Basics
To do some operations on the data in the database, then you must have to write the query in the predefined syntax of SQL.<br>
The syntax of the structured query language is a unique set of rules and guidelines, which is not case-sensitive. Its Syntax is defined and maintained by the ISO and ANSI standards.<br>
**Following are some most important points about the SQL syntax which are to remember:**<br>
1.SQL Queries can be written both in uppercase and lowercase but uppercase improves the readability of the SQL query.<br>
2.SQL statements or syntax are dependent on text lines. We can place a single SQL statement on one or multiple text lines.<br>

### SQL Statement
SQL statements tell the database what operation you want to perform on the structured data and what information you would like to access from the database.
The statements of SQL are very simple and easy to use and understand. They are like plain English but with a particular syntax.

Each SQL statement begins with any of the SQL keywords and ends with the semicolon (;).
The semicolon is used in the SQL for separating the multiple Sql statements which are going to execute in the same call.
